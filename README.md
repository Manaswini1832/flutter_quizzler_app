# quizzler

- Learnt about Dart Classes and Objects
- Understood what properties and methods of a class are
 - Property : Variable associated with a class
 - Method : Function associated with a class
 - Object : Instance of the class we created
- Learnt about the 4 pillars of OOP using the car analogy
 1) Abstraction : Split functionality into different components that have their own defined roles
 2) Encapsulation : Classes are strictly separated and interact only sometimes otherwise they are fully independent of each other
 3) Inheritance : A class inheriting properties and methods from its parent class
    
    Say parent class is called Car
    
    //New child class

    class ElectricCar extends Car{}

 4) Polymorphism : We override some properties or methods of parent class using the @override keyword, can also have super.(method name)

- Learnt how to do the exact same thing(i.e. creating the Question class) in 2 different ways and changing its children classes accordingly
